# Safety, Risiko Management

::: callout-important
## Safety \| Safety-Critical

**Safety** is defined as preventing harm to humans/environment, while **safety-critical systems** ensure this property.
:::

::: callout-important
## Risk \| Safety-Integrity

**Risk** is a measure of the likelihood, and the consequences, of a hazardous event.

**Safety-integrity** is a measure of the likelihood of the safety system correctly performing its task.
:::

## Terms

-   **Hazard**: A situation in which there is actual or potential danger for people or environment.
-   **Accident**: Unintended event harming people or environment.
-   **Incident**: Unintended event which does not harm, but has the potential to do so.
-   **Risk**: Likelihood of hazard occurrence, and the likely consequences. $\text{Risk} = \text{Severity} \times \text{Probability}$
-   **Fault**: Defect in system. Can be **random** or **systematic.**
-   **Error**: Deviation from the required operation of the system.
-   **System Failure**: Occures when system fails to perform its required function.
-   **Casualities** (Kausalitäten): The presence of a fault *may* lead to an error, which *may* lead to a system failure, which *may* lead to an accident.

## Requirements

Requirements give a system the properties of **integrity and dependability**.

This demands: (1) **Safety**, (2) **Reliability**, (3) **Availability**, (4) **Maintainability**.

::: callout-warning
## Conflicts

In general, the various requirements to a system are conflicting among themselves.
:::

### Process (Iterative!)

1.  Identification of hazards associated with the system
2.  Classification the hazards
3.  Determination of methods to deal with hazards
4.  Assignment of reliability and availability requirements
5.  Determination of safety integrity level
6.  Specification of development method appropriate to integrity level

## Verification, Validation & Certification (V&V&C)

-   **Verification**: Confirms system meets specifications
-   **Validation**: Ensures fitness for intended purpose
-   **Certification**: Obtains regulatory approval through evidence documentation
-   Key distinction example: Medical device passing lab tests (verification) but failing clinical trials (validation)

## Hazard & Risk Analysis

-   **Hazard identification** methods:
    -   *FMEA* *(Failure mode and effects analysis)*: Analyzes component failure effects on ultimate consequences.\
        ![](images/paste-1.png)
    -   *HAZOP (Hazard and operability studies)*: Uses guidewords to detect operational deviations.\
        ![](images/paste-2.png)
    -   *ETA (Event tree analysis)*: Model effects from starting point forward to determine possible consequences.\
        ![](images/paste-3.png)
    -   *FTA (Fault tree analysis)*: Identify hazards and determine their possible causes.\
        ![](images/paste-4.png)

## Risk Analysis

-   **Risk classification** combines severity (catastrophic/negligible) and frequency (frequent/incredible). Risks are categorized as intolerable (I) to negligible (IV).

$$
\text{Risk} = \text{Severity} \times \text{Probability}
$$

![](images/paste-5.png){fig-align="center" width="7cm"}

### Severity of Hazardous Event

![](images/paste-6.png){fig-align="center" width="8cm"}

### Frequency of Hazardous Event

![](images/paste-7.png){fig-align="center" width="8cm" height="3cm"}

### Risk Classification

![](images/paste-8.png){fig-align="center" width="8cm"}

### Integrity Classification

**ALARP-Rule**: Class II & III is only acceptable if it is **A**s **L**ow **A**s **R**easonably **P**racticable

Risk can be reduces by safety features. Achieved reduction depends upon integrity of these features.

Safety integrity is how likely a safety system is to perform its job correctly, under all conditions, and for the required time.

#### Safety Integrity Levels (SIL)

![](images/paste-9.png){fig-align="center" width="8cm"}

### Hardware Integrity

**Hardware integrity** is that part of the safety integrity relating to dangerous *random* hardware failures.

### Systematic Integrity

**Systematic integrity** is that part of the safety integrity relating to dangerous *systematic* failures.

### Software Integrity

**Software integrity** is that part of the safety integrity relating to dangerous *software* failures.

## Achieving Safety Integrity

The process involves iterative design stages and layered fault mitigation strategies to meet safety-critical system requirements.

### Core Design Process

1.  **Abstraction**: Identify essential system properties
2.  **Decomposition**: Break systems into analyzable components
3.  **Elaboration**: Add implementation details
4.  **Decision**: Select optimal design alternatives

### Fault Mitigation Strategies

Four complementary approaches:

1.  **Avoidance**: Prevent faults during design phase
2.  **Removal**: Eliminate faults through testing/reviews
3.  **Detection**: Identify faults during operation
4.  **Tolerance**: Maintain functionality despite faults

### Fault Characteristics

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Types} & \textbf{Examples} \\
\hline
Nature & Random (HW) vs Systematic & $\alpha$-particle errors vs spec bugs \\
\hline
Duration & Permanent/Transient/Intermittent & Broken chip vs cosmic rays \\
\hline
Extent & Localized vs Global & Single sensor vs power failure \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

**Hardware Fault Tolerance:**

-   **Static** (TMR/NMR): Mask faults via majority voting (3-5 modules)
-   **Dynamic**: Detect & switch to backups
-   **Hybrid**: Combine masking + reconfiguration

**Software Fault Tolerance:**

-   **N-version Programming**: Parallel diverse implementations (Airbus/Shuttle)
-   **Recovery Blocks**: Fallback modules with acceptance tests
-   **Information**: Additional data (parity / checksum)
-   **Temporal**: Repeat calculations

### Key Challenges

-   Common-mode failures require **diversity** in:
    -   Implementation methods
    -   Programming languages
    -   Hardware platforms
-   **Systematic faults (spec/design errors)** are harder to mitigate than random HW faults
-   No single technique provides complete protection

**Critical Insight**: Achieving safety integrity requires combining multiple fault mitigation strategies through iterative design refinement, as perfect fault elimination is impossible in complex systems.

**Detection**: Functional checking, Consistency checking, Signal comparison, Checking pairs, Information redundancy, Instruction monitoring, Loopback testing, Watchdog timers, Bus monitoring, Power supply monitoring

## Fault Tolerance

-   **Redundancy strategies**:

    -   *TMR (Triple Modular Redundancy):* Voting systems mask faults via majority logic (3 modules)

        ![](images/paste-15.png)

        ![](images/paste-16.png)

        ![](images/paste-17.png)

    -   *NMR*: Voting systems mask faults via majority logic (3-5 modules). Allows for $\frac{N-1}{2}$ modules to fail\
        ![](images/paste-18.png)

    -   *Dynamic redundancy*: Switches to backup modules after fault detection.\
        ![](images/paste-19.png)

    -   *Self checking pair*: The outputs are compared and give indication of failure\
        ![](images/paste-20.png)

-   **Diversity**: Combines different implementations/languages to avoid common-mode failures.

-   **Software fault tolerance**: Uses *N-version programming* (parallel implementations) or *recovery blocks* (fallback modules with acceptance tests).

## Reliability

::: callout-note
## Reliability

Reliability $R$ is the probability of a component or system functioning correctly over time $R(t)$. Describing a statistical behaviour of a component or system.

Given: Period of time, set of operating conditions.

$$
R(t)=\frac{n(t)}{N}
$$

with $n(t)$ number of working elements, and $N$ number of original elements.
:::

### Unreliability

Probability $Q(t)$ that a system will **not** function over a given period of time. $Q(t)+R(t)=1$

$$
Q(t)=\frac{n_f(t)}{N}=1-R(t)
$$

with $n_f(t)$ number of failed components at time $t$.

### Failure Rate

The rate $z(t)$ at which a device fails

$$
z(t)=\frac{1}{n(t)}\cdot\underbrace{\frac{dn_f(t)}{dt}}_{Failures}
$$

![](images/paste-21.png){fig-align="center" width="7cm"}

For a constant **failure rate** $z(t)=\lambda$ the probability of a system working correctly decreases exponentially

$$R(t)=e^{-\lambda t}$$

### Time-Variant Failure Rates

Software failures which are systematic and correctable the failure rate decreases with time. **Weibull** distribution

$$
R(t)=e^{-\left(\frac{t}{\eta}\right)^\beta}
$$

![](images/paste-24.png){fig-align="center" width="6cm"}

## Mean Times

### Mean Time to Failure

Expected time before first failure

$$
MTTF=\int_{0}^{\infty}R(t)dt=\frac{1}{\lambda}
$$

::: callout-caution
## Reliability

With $\lambda=0.001$ failure/h $MTTF=1000h$.

But at $t=1000h$ the reliability is only $R(t)\approx0.37$ (chance for running at 1000h mark is 37%)
:::

### Mean Time to Repair

Time to repair given by repairability $\mu$

$$
MTTR=\frac{1}{\mu}
$$

### Mean Time Between Failures

$$
MTBF=MTTF+MTTR
$$

### Failure in Time

Number of failures expected in $1\times10^9h$ of cumulative operation hours

$$
FIT=1\times10^9\cdot\frac{1}{MTBF}
$$

## Reliability Modelling

### Series Systems

Failure of **any** **component fails**

$$
R(t)=R_1(t)\cdot R_2(t)\cdots R_N(t)=\prod_{i=1}^N R_i(t)
$$

$$
\lambda=\lambda_1+\lambda_2+\cdots+\lambda_N=\sum_{i=1}^N\lambda_i
$$

### Parallel Systems

System operational as long as **one component is functioning**

$$
R(t)=1-Q(t)=1-\prod_{i=1}^N(1-R_i(t))
$$

## Reliability Prediction

There is extensive (usually MIL std.) literature but often with lots of unknown variables.

## Reliability Assessment

How to proof that a system fails less then once in $1 \times 10^9$ hour (i.e. $\approx$ 100 000 year) of operation?

Trust the development techniques.
:::

## Software Safety

Common faults:

Coding faults, logical errors within calculations, numeric under- and overflows, stack under- and overflows, range under- and overflows (arrays!), uninitialised variables, unintended side effects, truncation by casts, rounding effects, memory leaks, ...
